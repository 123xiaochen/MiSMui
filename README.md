# MiSMui

## Introduction
MiSMui is an R shiny application that can be easily launched from a local web browser to help scientists without programming expertise to analyze (MiSM Database) microbial secondary metabolites biosynthesis gene cluster database.

For some reasons, MiSMui has not been made public, but we are trying to build it into an open source public analysis platform. Please stay tuned.
